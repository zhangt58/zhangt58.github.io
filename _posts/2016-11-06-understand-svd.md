Singular value decomposition, or SVD is useful when the inverse form of an
matrix is to be figured out. The main approach is
to decomposite a matrix (``A``) to be multiplication of several matrices,
i.e. ``A = S * V * D``, which is for SVD. You'll feel the beauty of math when
understanding it just a little bit, and it is interesting.

class Particle(object):
    def __init__(self, np):
        pass
