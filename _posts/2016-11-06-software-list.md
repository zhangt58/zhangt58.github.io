Below is a list of names, each one could be the name of one software 
project, or software package, or github repository. I created them in
the last few years, for the interest of software programming, especially
Python, I will add more into this list.

- ``felapps``

    > ``felapps`` is a Python package developed for the commissioning of 
    > free-electron laser facility, with the intention of providing useful
    > toolkits for the high-level applications, both command line 
    > interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) are 
    > developed/under development.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/felapps){:target="_blank"}
    * [Documentation](https://archman.github.io/felapps/){:target="_blank"}
    * [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/felapps){:target="_blank"}

- ``beamline``

    > ``beamline`` is a Python package created for accelerator (RF LINAC)
    > online-modeling requirement, trying to supply both CLI and GUI 
    > working environment, upon the already built infrastructure, 
    > extensions/tools could be developed to solve specific problems.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/beamline){:target="_blank"}
    * [Documentation](https://archman.github.io/beamline/){:target="_blank"}
    * [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beamline){:target="_blank"}

- ``pydraw``

    > ``pydraw`` is a Python application (GUI) to illustrate the basic 
    > features of Python and wxPython.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/pydraw){:target="_blank"}

- ``pelican``

    > ``pelican`` is a C++ application (CLI) to simulate the free-electron
    > laser process, i.e. the radiation amplification procedure due to the 
    > interaction between electron beam and radiation itself.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/pelican){:target="_blank"}

- ``vFEL``

    > EPICS soft-ioc (C/C++) for virtual FEL machine 
    > (FEL simulation section is to be done), the data source should be 
    > came from ``beamline`` model,
    > so the two packages should be used together.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/vFEL){:target="_blank"}

- ``modu``

    > C++ application (CLI) to simulate the interaction between electron
    > beam and optical laser, basically the modulation process in FEL
    > physics, the generated electron beam phase space could be used
    > by ``Elegant`` or ``Genesis 1.3``.

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/modu){:target="_blank"}

- ``pyrpn``

    > RPN solver written by Python, RPN is brief for 
    > "Reverse Polish Notation".

    * [Source code](https://github.com/archman/pyrpn){:target="_blank"}
    * [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrpn){:target="_blank"}
